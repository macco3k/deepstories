  NOTE: Whenever a fix or enhancement is in place, it will be announced
  on the channel '#mud-updates'.

  OTHER NOTE: There is a mailing list where people can say things like
  "hey, the mud's down, what's up with that?" In fact, since this is
  the only thing the list is used for, you should join it if you are
  interested in this subject. To join, go to

Dorm A
This is a very long room, lined with multi-tiered bunks. Flimsy partitions between the tiers may provide a modicum of privacy. These spartan living quarters could house hundreds, many of whom are sleeping here right now. A narrow staircase set in the north wall leads up.

Note to new users: Most of us hang out in the Adventurer's Lounge. The Lounge is up, and then west, from this location (or just type 'lounge'). If you get lost, type '@holler Help me! I'm lost!' and someone will try to find you.

Players: jpt, Recchi
Visible Exits: up (to the Long Hall), down (to Dorm B)

Toyshop and Floyditorium
Bulging toychests make this a child's (or child-at-heart's) dream.  Play all day, play all night. A small booth has been erected and is staffed by a friendly robot. The sign over it says, "INFOKOM GAMEZ 5 cents".  A small notice on the door reads, "PLEASE RETURN TOYS TO THIS ROOM WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH THEM."

You can see: banana machine, faucets, toy catalogue, a crystal ball, cuddly walrus, cloak, tic-tac-toe, thermometer, waldo whisper object, checkers board, Werewolf rules, Mike Tyson, frobozz magic dispenser, fun shiny toy, jukebox, orange door, mind chess, storyharp, save button, Best of Speed?, basketball, midterm monster, green button, colourcoding device, the '#ifmud-sucks' cube, Gak, Photocopier, ice cream cone, Rejected I7 Keywords, yellow button, dfan's quest, FREE DONUTS machine, muffled groan, orange, dozen red roses, ClubFloyd Suggestions, jellybean, monkey guru, RPS Bot 3000, soda reading 'Don't drink me!', NightFloyd Suggestions, Pun Police Whistle

[clubfloyd] DavidW says, "I'm curious to see how people find it."
[clubfloyd] Doug asks, "So we're playing a Euro dice game?"
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says, "Maga mentioned to the author we'd be playing.  I need to get back into the flow.  I thought I would be caught up entirely, but hit a glitch with a transcript last night that stopped the process.  Vimes troubleshot it, though, and so we should be entirely caught up, to include ClubFloyd, today.  Before we leave today, let's decide what we're playing this week so I can actually use the RSS feed and let the author know before the last minute and stuff."
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says (to Doug), "That's what I hear."
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline asks, "Zach, have you played it?"
[clubfloyd] Zach says, "Nope."
[clubfloyd] Doug asks, "will the author be joining us?"
[clubfloyd] Zach says, "I saved all the winners for last."
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says, "Mmkay, cool.  Three is enough."
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says (to Zach), "Not at all sure."
[clubfloyd] Binder clears his throat.
[clubfloyd] Doug asks, "Or maybe the author is already here??!?"
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says, "But the cool new thing about ClubFloyd is that -- oh, hi, Binder."
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says (to Doug), "OMG I KNOW"
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline asks, "Binder, have YOU played it?"
[clubfloyd] Binder says, "I have not."
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline exclaims, "Four is merrier than three!"
[clubfloyd] Doug says, "don't count me, I may be in & out as I try to switch to a better desktop environment."
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says, "Anyway, what I was saying is that I can now process a transcript easily in about three to five minutes, so the author, even if they're not here, WILL actually see the transcript.  I'm giddy."
[clubfloyd] Binder says, "That is an awesome time savings."
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says, "Anyway, shall we begin?  Yes, Lisa."

Floyd | Eurydice isn't exactly over-endowed with special commands because I
Floyd | lack the programming werewithall for anything that cool.  I hope most
Floyd | of the things you might want to do are accomodated in the body of the
Floyd | game anyway and that context-specific actions are adequately sign
Floyd | posted.  But you might want to consider the following: PLAY (a musical
Floyd | instrument should you acquire one), TALK TO (for interacting with
Floyd | people) and TURN AROUND (under a very specific set of circumstances).
Floyd | I would also recommend that you try repeating actions if it seems
Floyd | appropriate, since you will likely find they have different outcomes -
Floyd | especially when it comes to talking to people.  With reference to
Floyd | TURNING AROUND, if you happen to be in a situation in which it might
Floyd | not be ideal to TURN AROUND, doubling back on yourself will also

[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says, "Well, I'm kind of keen on the idea of being miserable in Celine's room, but there are also people to talk to, so I'm torn."

Floyd | paper, ribbons and decorations is still beneath the eaves, or if her

Floyd | ## John's Room
Floyd | John's room occupies the attic spaces.  It is a room of peculiar
Floyd | geometries.  The whole place is a mess at present, and the blinds of
Floyd | the skylights are down so that triangular shadows cast themselves
Floyd | across the walls.  There are no obvious signs of Celine, but why would
Floyd | there be?  There is the jester's mask she bought John for Christmas
Floyd | hanging on the wall.

Floyd | blinds fall back into place.  You don't want John to know you were

Floyd | You have no intention of stealing it but you unhook it carefully from

Floyd | You look out at the world from a different face, your peripheral
Floyd | vision imprisoned by the edges of the eyeholes.  You trace your

Floyd | There are lots of people gathered in the living room.  Stepping inside
Floyd | unfortunately catches the attention of the one you like least.  Laurie
Floyd | clatters towards you and, before you can do anything to save yourself,
Floyd | captures you in a hug you feel vaguely socially obligated to endure.
Floyd | You hold yourself as rigid as a blade until she goes away again.  The

Floyd |
Floyd | There are so many people here.   Have they come to ... what? Stare at
Floyd | the bereft?  Why?  Is this how other people grieve?  En masse?
Floyd |
Floyd | Your housemate John is sitting cross-legged on the floor at the end of
Floyd | the coffee table, frowning over a game of a Go.  His opponent, Twitch,
Floyd | sits opposite and appears much more laid-back about the whole
Floyd | business.  Rick is slumped on the sofa, a bottle of port at his elbow;
Floyd | Elsie is sitting next to him, apparently watching the game.  Jess is
Floyd | huddled in a cloak on the other sofa, Adrian beside her, looking
Floyd | almost as uncomfortable as you probably do.  As for Laurie, she's
Floyd | leaning against the fireplace, and wearing an expression of infinite
Floyd | suffering like she's living her own little Victorian melodrama.
Floyd |
Floyd | And finally, in the far corner of the room by the open door to the
Floyd | kitchen, like a person in its own right, is the last piece of

Floyd |
Floyd | Currently, it's all cluttered with people. Your housemate John is
Floyd | sitting cross-legged on the floor at the end of the coffee table,
Floyd | frowning over a game of a Go.  His opponent, Twitch, sits opposite and
Floyd | appears much more laid-back about the whole business.  Rick is slumped
Floyd | on the sofa, a bottle of port at his elbow; Elsie is sitting next to
Floyd | him, apparently watching the game.  Jess is huddled in a cloak on the
Floyd | other sofa, Adrian beside her, looking almost as uncomfortable as you
Floyd | feel.  As for Laurie (fucking Laurie), she's leaning against the

Floyd | ## Vaughan Thomas Exterior
Floyd | Vaughan Thomas Ward is another grey building.  It has a bow-window
Floyd | which looks like an ill-at-ease addition to its uniformity.  There is
Floyd | also an awkward, spindly tree guarding a nearby bench.
Floyd |
Floyd | The door that leads west into Vaughan Thomas has been painted blue.
Floyd | There is a doorbell next to it in industrial grey.  The path leading
Floyd | to and from Vaughan Thomas lies to the east.

Floyd | a Herculean labour the like of which she resented performing.

Floyd | As you edge past the Nurse, she put out a log-like arm to momentarily
Floyd | stop you entering.  "You'll need to see the Doctor first," she says,
Floyd | gruffly. "You can't take a patient away without the doctor's
Floyd | permission."  You nod your understanding, although your mind is full
Floyd | of Escape from Alcatraz visions, search lights flashing, sirens
Floyd | screaming and helicopters whirling overhead as you and Celine run,
Floyd | hand in hand, giggling into a different coloured future.
Floyd |
Floyd | ## Vaughan Thomas Corridor
Floyd | There are soft felt pinboards on the wall, above a row of chairs.  An
Floyd | over-stacked bookself shoved in the corner and a square table do
Floyd | nothing to break the monotony.  The Warneford Hospital has a
Floyd | distinctive smell.  It is the smell of a place that very consciously
Floyd | has no smell, underscored by a desperate edge of nicotine.

Floyd | his face naked in pain and sorrow, and then his cold hands are

Floyd | of refracted light and then they're gone.  There is a vicious crack,
Floyd | like a bone breaking, and the Doctor flings the pieces of the lyre to
Floyd | the floor.  In seconds nothing remains of the lyre but a sprinkling of
Floyd | dust the colour of old blood.  "Take her then," he cries, "take her

Floyd | Time, a game for telling fairytales.  "Are you sure I used to like
Floyd | this?" Celine is asking.  "Yes," you say, "it's one of your
Floyd | favourites."  "You used to win all the time," Jess adds.  Celine
Floyd | laughs, uncertain.  "That doesn't seem very likely," she says.  "It'll
Floyd | come back," you say, half-reassuring, half-pleading.  Except it, of
Floyd | course, doesn't.  None of it does.
Floyd |
Floyd | A small, perfectly square, yellow-painted room, probably identical to
Floyd | all the others on this corridor.  The carpet is a greyish-blue, only

Floyd | black cardigan hanging on the back of the chair, books and a radio on

Floyd | A small, perfectly square, yellow-painted room, probably identical to
Floyd | all the others on this corridor.  The carpet is a greyish-blue, only
Floyd | slightly stained.  There is a pine-coloured wardrobe and bedside

Floyd | the bedside table - but it's not the kind of room you can personalise.

Floyd | "Of course you'll miss her.  It will never be easy but it will be

Floyd | A young-ish, not entirely unpretty woman, who steals from the other

Floyd |
Floyd | A torrent of cherry blossom petals pours from between your fingers as

Floyd | they begin to wither and then they turn to ice and then they shatter
Floyd | where they fall, and each breaking pricks your skin like a wasp sting.
Floyd | And the lyre weeps and so does the woman, and the air all around you
Floyd | grows cold and heavy and blots out everything until there is only
Floyd | silence and the silver traces of disappearing tears and melting ice.
Floyd | Your hands are empty; the lyre is gone.  And the woman is looking at
Floyd | you as if she doesn't like you much.  "My husband.." she says "He
Floyd | doesn't like ... he won't ... you'd better go.  She's waiting for you

Floyd | her, back to the wall, feet dangling off the end of the bed.  You'd
Floyd | snuck in and you're kneeling on the floor, elbows folded on the
Floyd | coverlet.  You're probably pretty damn uncomfortable.  Spread out
Floyd | between you are brightly coloured cards. You're playing Once Upon A
Floyd | Time, a game for telling fairytales.  "Are you sure I used to like
Floyd | this?" Celine is asking.  "Yes," you say, "it's one of your
Floyd | favourites."  "You used to win all the time," Jess adds.  Celine
Floyd | laughs, uncertain.  "That doesn't seem very likely," she says.  "It'll
Floyd | come back," you say, half-reassuring, half-pleading.  Except it, of
Floyd | course, doesn't.  None of it does.

Floyd | She thrusts the plant into his face.  "Then I want this," she says.

Floyd | "I offer you my kingdom and all you want is a weed?"
Floyd |
Floyd |  She shrugs.  "You'll never understand."
Floyd |
Floyd | "Very well," says the Doctor, finally.  "Since you ask it of me."  He
Floyd | turns on you, contempt scored across his face. "You'll find Celine in

Floyd | ## Celine's Room
Floyd | The memories of past visits rise up to gnaw at you like wolves.  You
Floyd | see Celine, sitting on the bed, the colour washed out of her by her
Floyd | surroundings, her knees pulled up to her chin.  Jess is there beside
Floyd | her, back to the wall, feet dangling off the end of the bed.  You'd
Floyd | snuck in and you're kneeling on the floor, elbows folded on the
Floyd | coverlet.  You're probably pretty damn uncomfortable.  Spread out
Floyd | between you are brightly coloured cards. You're playing Once Upon A
Floyd | Time, a game for telling fairytales.  "Are you sure I used to like
Floyd | this?" Celine is asking.  "Yes," you say, "it's one of your
Floyd | favourites."  "You used to win all the time," Jess adds.  Celine
Floyd | laughs, uncertain.  "That doesn't seem very likely," she says.  "It'll
Floyd | come back," you say, half-reassuring, half-pleading.  Except it, of
Floyd | course, doesn't.  None of it does.
Floyd |
Floyd | A small, perfectly square, yellow-painted room, probably identical to
Floyd | all the others on this corridor.  The carpet is a greyish-blue, only
Floyd | slightly stained.  There is a pine-coloured wardrobe and bedside
Floyd | table, a single bed and a chair.  There are signs of occupation - the
Floyd | black cardigan hanging on the back of the chair, books and a radio on
Floyd | the bedside table - but it's not the kind of room you can personalise.
Floyd | It is a transitory space.  Above the bed, the wall is splashed with a
Floyd | grid of cards and postcards, twenty or thirty of them maybe, pinned up
Floyd | there as bright as butterfly wings.
Floyd |
Floyd | You can see the Women's Corridor through the door to the east.

Floyd |
Floyd | The woman seems to light up as you offer her Celine's plant. For a
Floyd | brief moment, a cloud engulfs the moon and you think she might be, or
Floyd | once have been, quite beautiful. But then the moon bursts free and
Floyd | she's just an bare-foot oldish woman draped in dead flowers, clutching
Floyd | a pot plant like it's a priceless thing.  "She's lovely," she says,
Floyd | running a reverent finger over one of the leaves.  "I'll love her, I
Floyd | promise."  There is a brief, awkward pause.  "Oh."  The woman fixes

Floyd | soundless feet through the grey corridors of the Warneford until you
Floyd | come to the Doctor's office.
Floyd |
Floyd | ## Doctor's Office
Floyd | As soon as you enter his office, the Doctor's attention flies to the
Floyd | woman with you.  "Is there something I can do for you?" he asks.
Floyd |
Floyd | The woman meets his ardent gaze with disinterest.  "There's something
Floyd | you can do for my friend here," she says.  "And don't give me the
Floyd | usual rubbish about the rules, I know just how flexible your rules can
Floyd | be."
Floyd |
Floyd | "That was an isolated incident," he replies, flushing. He seems to
Floyd | have forgotten you're standing there, because he blurts out his next
Floyd | words with a terrible, naked earnestness: "I know I have wronged you
Floyd | but I cannot ... that is ... I need ... " His hand moves compulsively
Floyd | to his heart as if he means to pluck it out and offer it to her, but
Floyd | she glares him back to silence.  Finally, he says, with something of
Floyd | his customary coldness: "I would do anything to assure your comfort
Floyd | while you're here with me."
Floyd |
Floyd | She thrusts the plant into his face.  "Then I want this," she says.
Floyd |
Floyd | "I offer you my kingdom and all you want is a weed?"
Floyd |
Floyd |  She shrugs.  "You'll never understand."
Floyd |
Floyd | "Very well," says the Doctor, finally.  "Since you ask it of me."  He
Floyd | turns on you, contempt scored across his face. "You'll find Celine in
Floyd | the gardens beyond the Sun Room.  Take her with you, as you wish, but
Floyd | don't look back or she's mine forever."  And that seems to be the
Floyd | mattered settled.

Floyd |
Floyd | You are starting to wonder if perhaps they've forgotten you're there,
Floyd | or if answering the doorbell is a mere hobby, when there comes the
Floyd | sound of muted rattling and banging from behind the door as someone on

Floyd | eased open, just enough for you to squeeze through, by a Nurse,
Floyd | glowering at the effort required to perform the most basic tenets of

Floyd | There are soft felt pinboards on the wall, above a row of chairs.  An
Floyd | over-stacked bookself shoved in the corner and a square table do
Floyd | nothing to break the monotony.  The Warneford Hospital has a
Floyd | distinctive smell.  It is the smell of a place that very consciously
Floyd | has no smell, underscored by a desperate edge of nicotine.
Floyd |
Floyd | You strain to hear even the slightest hint of movement but there is
Floyd | nothing, nothing at all.  Perhaps you have been tricked.  Yes, that
Floyd | seems very likely.
Floyd |
Floyd | This interminably greyish corridor meanders north, west and south.
Floyd | East would take you outside again, through the blue door.

Floyd | ## Vaughan Thomas Exterior
Floyd | Vaughan Thomas Ward is another grey building.  It has a bow-window
Floyd | which looks like an ill-at-ease addition to its uniformity.  There is
Floyd | also an awkward, spindly tree guarding a nearby bench.
Floyd |
Floyd | The only thing that follows you now, it seems, is silence.
Floyd |
Floyd | The door that leads west into Vaughan Thomas has been painted blue.
Floyd | There is a doorbell next to it in industrial grey.  The path leading
Floyd | to and from Vaughan Thomas lies to the east.

Floyd | ## Vaughan Thomas Path
Floyd | The path sidles away down the side of the main building, taking you
Floyd | away from facades.  Here, there are no country house lawns, no
Floyd | sandstone and classical pillars. There are patches of scrubby grass,
Floyd | borders that may perhaps bloom one spring, and scattered buildings
Floyd | that are too perfectly, facelessly functional to have anything of
Floyd | beauty or ugliness to them.  There are jaunty painted signs to
Floyd | Cotswold House and Wintle Ward.
Floyd |
Floyd | Vaughan Thomas waits to the west, the Hospital Approach is to the
Floyd | east.

Floyd | ## Warneford exit
Floyd | Here on the Warneford lawn again you can see a streak of lightness at
Floyd | the eastern edge of the sky.  Behind you, a smear of gold and grey, is
Floyd | the Warneford.  Before you, to the northwest, the wrought iron gates,
Floyd | as tall as thistles to a child,  swinging open before you.

Floyd | You run through the gates and, as soon as both feet are indisputably
Floyd | over the threshold, you turn.  The shock of seeing her again, standing
Floyd | before you, looking no different to the last time you saw her alive,
Floyd | is too much for you. You fall but soft grass catches you, and laughter
Floyd | as heady as wine comes bubbling out of your mouth. Eurydice leans over
Floyd | you, while behind her the darkness peels away from the sky like a
Floyd | layer of dead skin.  There is a moment of confusion.  You feel an
Floyd | inexplicable coldness seeping into your skin from what should be the
Floyd | sun-warmed grass, and there is a babble of concerned voices - the
Floyd | wrong voices - calling out a name - the wrong name.  But then Eurydice
Floyd | kisses you and her lips are flower-petal soft and her mouth tastes of
Floyd | music and the sky is the colour of lapis-lazuli and, on the breeze,
Floyd | comes the scent of olive trees...

Floyd | This is "Fable", one of four possible endings for Eurydice.  To
Floyd | discover another, why not stop relying on the lyre to solve your

[clubfloyd] Doug asks, "hm, so was it because we used the coin before that we always got to Flowers?"
[clubfloyd] maga says, "I think you only get Fable if you use the lyre for everything, yes"
[clubfloyd] Doug asks, "also, wait, did we die?"
[clubfloyd] maga says, "or maybe for some proportion of things, to include the snake"
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says, "Well done."
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says, "I'm rather surprised that this came in second."
[clubfloyd] Doug says, "re-reading Emily's review now.  Interesting that she says 'I think it needed to do a better job of cluing the player about where to look for the second and subsequent playthroughs, by laying bare something about the game’s internal logic at the end that implies how a replay could go differently.'"
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says, "But then, scifi isn't my thing, and it *is* many people's thing."
[clubfloyd] Doug says, "because that seems like exactly what it does.  Maybe there was an update after her review"
[clubfloyd] maga says, "it was my choice for first place, at any rate"
[clubfloyd] maga says, "(though it has some obvious flaws, and I haven't really played Andromeda)"
[clubfloyd] Doug says, "oh, I thought you meant you were surprised it came as high as second.  I know I am."
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says, "I'm also surprised that nothing in the comp averaged higher than an 8, I wonder if that's the norm."
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says, "Surprised this didn't average out a bit higher than 7.15"
[clubfloyd] maga says (to Doug), "you spent quite a lot of time being confused about how to get the alternative endings, from my perspective"
[clubfloyd] maga says (to Jacq), "a number of reviews amounted to 'bah emo'"
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says, "They probably didn't get that far into it, I suspect."
[clubfloyd] Doug says, "well, I think I was confused because we got the hardest ending before the second-hardest ending"
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says, "But then, I am also all about the rainy day miasma stuff, so."
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says (to Doug), "Yeah."
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says, "And possibly the easiest ending last."
[clubfloyd] maga says (to Doug), "the 'hardest' ending is so totally not"
[clubfloyd] Doug says, "if we hadn't found the coin or the pills, I thnk it would have been easier to find Fable first"
[clubfloyd] maga says, "I mean, it does a pretty good job of directing you to the coin, and giving the coin to the boatman is so obvious that you were doing it even when you intended to lyre everything"

[clubfloyd] Doug says, "anyway, I thought it was a decent game (I liked some of the writing in particular, but apparently the opposite parts from what Jacq liked...), but it had a lot of rough edges and the game as a whole ultimately didn't really cohere for me."
[clubfloyd] Zach says, "I thought the writing was very enjoyable, but I wish the story had been fleshed out more apart from the myth."
[clubfloyd] Doug says, "I might not have gotten to a lot of the rough edges in the first two hours, though."
[clubfloyd] Doug says, "and yeah, what Zach said.  would have liked more interaction with the NPCs, I think."
[clubfloyd] Zach says, "I suppose the living room did a good job of that though."
[clubfloyd] Doug says, "certainly an impressive first game, though"
[clubfloyd] Zach says, "Any more and it might have hit the 2 hour limit."
[clubfloyd] Doug says, "better than mine!"
[clubfloyd] Zach asks, "So we don't know who wrote it or the author wants to remain anonymous?"
[clubfloyd] Doug says, "if anyone knows, they're not telling"
[clubfloyd] maga says, "I'm interviewing them for SPAG, and they claim that it is indeed their first game"
[clubfloyd] Doug says, "I think my least favorite part was all the yes/no questions"
[clubfloyd] Doug says, "which if you answered in the obvioisly boring way, actually led to one of the better endings (as in, you reject the fantasy stuff and just get on with life), but it didn't feel earned at all."
[clubfloyd] maga says, "there are other ways you can get that"
[clubfloyd] maga says, "but yeah, the game's structural premise leads to rewarding behaviour in counterintuitive ways, which is sort of the point, I think"
[clubfloyd] Doug says, "also, Celine ends up being a pretty vague character.  Maybe because of the intentionally vagueness of the relationship"
[clubfloyd] Doug says, "but there wasn't anything that suggested actually coming to terms with what happened to her, it was just sort of reliving her drug-damaged final weeks"
[clubfloyd] Doug asks, "I guess maybe the idea is that you regret not having taken her away from the hospital sooner?"
[clubfloyd] Doug asks, "and so actually getting her out gives you closure?"
[clubfloyd] Doug says, "but the way to get her out is to bribe the doctor's wife, which is just an unrelated obstacle puzzle"
Zach cried like a pre-schooler over the death of a walking sausage. C-
Zach has disconnected.

jenrexrode has had her fill of playing for now, and goes back to the Lounge.
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says, "Great session, folks."
[clubfloyd] Doug says, "anyway, thanks Jacq!  and thanks Zach & DavidW!"
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says, "Next week, we can't play the third place.  It's truly unFloydable."
Doug has had his fill of playing for now, and goes back to the Lounge.
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline asks, "Any desire to keep going down the list to other IF Comp entries?"
[clubfloyd] Tale says, "Oh, right, it has returneth"
[clubfloyd] Doug says, "I'd be happy to play Miseri's game, but who knows when I'll actually be around for club floyd again."
[clubfloyd] maga says, "I think the next few would not be a waste of time, though with Changes you might need to go to the walkthrough if you ever wanted to finish"
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says, "I'm not sure I'm around next week; I fly out that day for a trip, but I can set it up and will contact the author of whatever we choose to play."
[clubfloyd] Jacqueline says (to maga), "Good to know."
[clubfloyd] Doug | There are moments of humour, such as when you grab the cuddly Cthulhu doll. There are moments of pure horror, like when you see the skeletons in the hospital ward.
